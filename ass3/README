All programs can be run under linux by writing their respective names in terminal when the appropriate directory is open. 

Code can be compiled using gcc -lGL -lGLU -lglut -o robot assignment3.c

The menu system wasn't working for me on the computers in the lab, so I came up with the following control scheme for manipulating the robot parts and the camera angles:

W rotates the camera upwards
S rotates the camera downwards

A rotates the camera to the left
D rotates the camera to the right

Q rotates the camera clockwise
E rotates the camera counterclockwise

I pans the camera upwards
K pans the camera downwards
J pans the camera to the left
L pans the camera to the right
Y pans the camera towards the robot
U pans the camera away from the robot


To control the robot parts, the following keys were used (in addition to clicking the mouse):

Z controls the arm on what appears to be the left side
X controls the arm on what appears to be the right side
O rotates the head
P moves the robot up and down

right clicking moves the part in the opposite direction as left clicking.

Pressing g was supposed to put the camera into the robot's head, however I didn't end up implementing this properly.
